Rouselib
========
A small library for generating ``simulations'' of Rouse polymers. Since the
Rouse model is exactly solvable, we don't actually have to do much simulating,
this is more about drawing conformations from a known ensemble or evolving them
in time. In that sense, somewhat simulation-ish.
